A Mac OS X Screensaver - Shows people doing speedruns as your screensaver. 
---

This is an imaginitively titled screensaver that will download and run videos of people completing speed runs of games. I for one don't really have time to play games anymore, but I can sure enjoy watching people who do, do.

This screensaver should work on Mac OS X 10.6 and above. However, it has only been tested with 10.8. It will download a movie then continue playing every time the sceensaver loads until it finishes. There are options for which systems to download movies for, and which qualities to download from youtube.

Setup
----

Download this [zip file](https://raw.github.com/orta/GamesScreenSaver/master/web/GamesScreensaver.saver.zip) - unzip - double click the .screensaver. That will install it and open the System Preferences where you can choose the screensaver.

In order to build this I built a Screensaver Bootstrap app that emulates the Screensaver app whilst making it super easy to iterate fast on a screensaver. If you're building a screensaver this is really useful - especially as it means you can use the debug tools in Xcode.
